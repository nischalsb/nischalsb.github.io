                    <p align="justify">In 2016, I along with my friends established an organization known by the name
                        Educate Nepal
                        Initiative in order to spread the light of knowledge to every party of the country. I was made
                        the founding president
                        of the organization. With the help of executive members and other friends, we were able to
                        conduct a series of three grand
                        national level talk shows and book donation programme in various districts. We also took part in
                        establishing an e-library in
                        Jajarkot district. I had the honour to lead the organization for two consequetive terms.During
                        this time, we have been able to build
                        the identity of the organization. In March 2020 I stepped down and handed my responsibility to
                        newly elected president of the organization.
